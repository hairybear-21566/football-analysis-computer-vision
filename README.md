# Football Analysis Tool (Work in Progress)

This project is an ongoing effort to build an advanced football analysis tool. It processes football playback footage by analyzing each frame, detecting objects (e.g., players, ball, goalposts), and annotating them with bounding boxes and labels. The annotated frames are then used to recreate the video, providing insights into the gameplay.

## Key Features

- **Frame-by-frame analysis:** Each frame of the video is analyzed to identify and label key objects on the field.
- **Bounding box annotations:** Objects like players, ball, and goalposts are enclosed within bounding boxes and labeled with their respective names.
- **Video reformation:** The tool uses the annotated frames to reform the video, offering a clear visual understanding of object positions and movements throughout the game.

## Work in Progress

- **Object Detection:** Currently improving the accuracy and speed of object detection using a combination of image processing and deep learning techniques.
- **Annotation Optimization:** Enhancing the bounding box placement and labeling to ensure precision in fast-moving or crowded scenes.
- **Performance Improvements:** Working on reducing the processing time per frame to allow for real-time or near-real-time analysis.

## Future Plans

- **Player Tracking:** Add player tracking across frames to analyze movement patterns.
- **Tactical Analysis:** Integrate more advanced metrics for football tactics, such as formation recognition and passing networks.
- **Export Options:** Allow exporting annotated video and key statistics.

Stay tuned for updates! Contributions and feedback are always welcome.
